# Everest (Alpha)  
# Design Document     
#### By Siddharth Senthil    

## Summary
* Game Pitch:
    * Learn the basics of hiking, mountaineering, and survival as you prepare to face Earth's highest mountain.

* Inspiration:
    * This concept is based on an earlier idea from 1-Bit Jam 4, which I did not develop further: rather than the challenges you face getting stronger, other impairments are what contribute to an increase in difficulty
    * The 2015 film _Everest_ was a major inspiration for the theme.

* Player Experience:
    * The player starts off by completing small treks and works their way up to more advanced backpacking and mountaineering. They build the skills they will use later while learning new things. Each level will likely add a new major skill or two and also advance 2+ previous skills.

* Platform:
    * The game is developed for initial release on Windows and the web.

* Development Software:
    * Godot 4.4.1 and VSCode for programming
    * Aseprite for pixel art

## Target Audience:
* This game builds on itself, so anyone from a new gamer to those who already enjoy 2D games are part of the potential target audience.

## Gameplay Overview:
* The player controls a basic character, but skills learnt over time need to be utilized effectively for survival
